# WarpFrame

WarpFrame is a rendering engine designed to replicate the visual quirks and limitations of PlayStation 1-era graphics. It provides an authentic low-poly, wobbly-texture experience that defined the early 3D gaming era. The engine utilizes OpenGL, GLFW, and GLM to recreate the unique rendering artifacts of the PS1, such as texture warping, vertex jitter, and affine texture mapping.

## Project Overview

The name "WarpFrame" is inspired by the characteristic texture warping and vertex instability present in PlayStation 1 graphics. Due to the absence of floating-point precision in the PS1 hardware, textures often appeared distorted and inconsistent as objects moved. This renderer aims to faithfully recreate these effects while allowing for customization and experimentation.

## Features

- **Affine Texture Mapping**: Removes perspective correction, replicating the classic PS1 texture distortion.
- **Vertex Snapping**: Simulates the fixed-point arithmetic of the PS1, causing slight vertex jitter.
- **16-Bit Color Depth Simulation**: Reduces colors to mimic the visual style of PS1 graphics.
- **Low-Resolution Rendering**: Allows rendering at a reduced resolution and upscaling to replicate a retro aesthetic.
- **Fixed-Function Pipeline Emulation**: Recreates the rendering pipeline of early 3D hardware.
- **Dithering Effects**: Simulates PS1-style dithering to enhance color depth limitations.
- **Software Rendering Mode (Upcoming)**: Implements a software rasterization pipeline for accuracy.
- **Post-Processing Effects**: Includes options for CRT filters, scanlines, and other retro effects.

## Dependencies

WarpFrame uses Conan for project-wise dependency management. The following libraries are required:

- **GLFW**: Provides window management and input handling.
- **GLEW**: Loads OpenGL function pointers dynamically.
- **GLM**: Offers mathematics utilities, including vector and matrix operations.
- **stb_image (Upcoming)**: Handles image loading for textures.
- **ImGui (Upcoming)**: Will be integrated for debugging and UI support.
